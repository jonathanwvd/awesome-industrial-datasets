# Hill-Valley

**Summary:** Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y co-ordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a “bump” in the terrain) or a Valley (a “dip” in the terrain).

## Dataset Information

Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y-coordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a 'bump' in the terrain) or a Valley (a 'dip' in the terrain).

There are six files, as follows:

(a) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Training.data
(b) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Testing.data

These first two datasets (without noise) are a training/testing set pair where the hills or valleys have a smooth transition.

(c) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Training.data
(d) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Testing.data

These next two datasets (with noise) are a training/testing set pair where the terrain is uneven, and the hill or valley is not as obvious when viewed closely.

(e) Hill_Valley_sample_arff.text

The sample ARFF file is useful for setting up experiments, but is not necessary.

(f) Hill_Valley_visual_examples.jpg

This graphic file shows two example instances from the data.
